# Air Quality Analysis üçÉ

Collaborative Python project using Jupyter Notebooks.

Italian public authorities collect, process, and analyze air quality data to monitor pollution levels and their impact on public health. By combining air pollution data with sensor and administrative datasets, decision-makers (such as environmental agencies and public health organizations) can better understand pollution trends and exposure risks. The aim of this project is to visualize and analyze air quality data from Dati Lombardia to assess pollution levels and trends at different administrative levels within the region.

## Project Goals:
You are asked to develop a client-server application that supports users in querying and visualizing data retrieved from the Dati Lombardia air quality sensor dataset. The system should integrate and process real-time or historical air quality measurements to provide insights into pollution distribution, trends, and exposure risks.





## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up your environment, follow the instructions in one of the following scripts, depending on your OS:

Run the Setup Script on your terminal:

- macOS/Linux: [setup_env_mac_linux.sh](setup_env_mac_linux.sh)
- Windows: [setup_env_windows.bat](setup_env_windows.bat)


### Adding New Dependencies

If you need to install additional Python packages, activate your virtual environment and install them:

1. Activate your virtual environment:
   - macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`

2. Install the desired package using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install new-package-name



## üìÅ Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks
- `src/`: Reusable Python functions and modules
- `data/`: Local datasets (excluded from Git)
- `.venv/`: Local virtual environment (excluded from Git)

## üß™ Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python‚Äôs package installer)

## üîÑ Updating the Environment








# Project Name

Collaborative Python project using Jupyter Notebooks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

---

### **First Time Setup (Initial Installation)**

Follow these steps to set up the project from scratch when you clone it for the first time:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if you haven't done this already):
   - Clone the project to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/astroedo/air_quality_analysis.git
     cd air_quality_analysis
     ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   - For macOS/Linux, run the setup script:
     ```bash
     bash setup_env_mac_linux.sh
     ```
   - For Windows, run the Windows batch file:
     ```bash
     setup_env_windows.bat
     ```
   - This will create a virtual environment (`.venv/`) and install the required Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - If the setup script doesn't activate the environment for you (in case you‚Äôre doing it manually), activate the virtual environment:
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - After activating the virtual environment, make sure all required dependencies are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**:
   - You can now open Jupyter Notebooks and start working on your project:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   This will open Jupyter in your browser, where you can start running notebooks from the `notebooks/` directory.

---

### **Subsequent Runs (After the First Time)**

Once the virtual environment and dependencies are set up, follow these simplified steps to start working on the project again:

1. **Navigate to Your Project Folder**:
   - Go to the folder where your project is stored:
     ```bash
     cd project-name
     ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Any New Dependencies (if applicable)**:
   - If new dependencies were added (for example, if `requirements.txt` was updated), install them:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebooks:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   You can now open and run the notebooks as usual.
