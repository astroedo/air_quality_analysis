# air_quality_analysis
Italian public authorities analyze air quality data to monitor pollution and its health impacts. By integrating air pollution, sensor, and administrative data, decision-makers can assess trends and risks. This project visualizes and analyzes air quality data from Dati Lombardia to evaluate pollution levels across different administrative areas.
