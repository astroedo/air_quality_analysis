# Air Quality Analysis 🍃

Air pollution is a growing concern, affecting public health and the environment. To address this, our project, develops a client-server application for analyzing and visualizing air quality data from Dati Lombardia. By integrating real-time sensor data, we provide insights into pollution trends, aiding decision-makers in monitoring and mitigating risks.
